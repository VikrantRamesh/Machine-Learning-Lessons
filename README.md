# Machine-Learning-Lessons
This repository consists of all the machine learning mini projects done by me.

Discription of the projects:

Lesson 1- Linear Regrssion:
          This is a simple linear regression project which analyses the various medium of advertising of a product and the corresponding sales that it produces. The three medium of adverising that the dataset offers are - TV, Newspaper and Radio. The linear regression model predicts the sales that will be generated, given the money put into each advertising streams. Both single variable prediction and multi-variable predictions are made using the Linear Regression model imported from sklearn.
          
          Lessons Learnt:
        -> Scatter Plot using Matplotlib.pyplot
        -> Sub-plots and over-layered graphs
        -> Single variable and Multi Variable Regression Models

Lesson 2- Big Mart Sales:
        This project is about making predictions on the sales of particular items based upon various physical properties of the item. This project foccuses on Exploratory data Analysis, spending considerable time on data cleaning and analytical activities like- filling missing data-points, detecting and removing outliers, Label Encoding of catagorical data, analysing unique values, maximum, minimum, mean and mode of numerical values.etc.  
        
           Lessons Learnt:
        -> The steps involved in EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
        -> How to Label encode data with various tools like - Pandas get_dummies, sklearn's labelencoder.etc
        -> How to test validation split the given data and how to check the accuracy of the model with the same.
        -> Predict the outcomes for the Test data and store the result in a csv file.

Lesson 3- Titanic Survivors:
          This project involves logistic regression where the model predicts whether a person onboard the Titanic survived the crash or not. This mainly foccuses on the idea of heat map (Correlation between the variables), confusion matrix, Precision score, Recall score, f1-score, accuracy and other similar model building and testing tools and mechanisms. On the other hand, a brief EDA is conducted before the model building activity.
          
          Lessons Learnt:
        -> The steps involved in model Builing - Correlation between the variables, selection of variables.etc.
        -> Building a Logistic regression model.
        -> Study of Heat maps and Confusion matrix
        -> Judge the model using precision, recall and F1 Scores.
